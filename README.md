# Simple Flask API

This is a fask server/api to convert STEP Files to [ThreeJS](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#manual/en/introduction/Creating-a-scene) readable json/object. 

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

if you want to run this api/project locally on your machine you need to have [conda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) pre-installed on your OS, 
Or if you want to just deploy it on a server jump to [Deployment](#deployment) section.

### Run This project locally on your machine

After installing anaconda (comes with python3.* pre-installed), you can follow this steps:

Clone this Repository on your machine, open your terminal/cmd.. and type:

```
git clone https://github.com/zerrouki95samir/stp2json.git
```
cd to stp2json folder:

```
cd stp2json
```

Create the environment from the environment.yml file:

```
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

After the conda env is created, you need to activate it with this command:

```
conda activate stp2json
```

Run the api server:

```
python run.py
```

If everything goes well, you will see this line at the end of your command line!:  

```
Running on http://0.0.0.0:33508/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)
```

## Running the tests

Now that our server is up and running, we need to do some testing, so we need to send a POST requests with stp/step file data, I've already prepared some code with php-curl or python-requests  module, you can just open the [base url](http://localhost:33508/) that appeared when the server ran or you can simply click here: [http://localhost:33508/](http://localhost:33508/) 
And the [Simple Explanation](http://localhost:33508/) the first paragraph

### Break down into end to end tests

If you [read](https://stp2jsonv2.herokuapp.com/) and test the API server using the [python/php-Curl codes template](https://stp2jsonv2.herokuapp.com/stp2json) I have provided for you to do a POST Request, you will get a successful response as a json object


## Deployment

Now!, Let's talk about the deployment, i already deployed this flask-api on [my heroku server](https://stp2jsonv2.herokuapp.com/), using the Dockerfile located in main directory, 
you need to have [heroku cli](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli) and [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/) installed on your machine.
After you install the CLI, run the heroku login command. Youâ€™ll be prompted to enter any key to go to your web browser to complete login. 
The CLI will then log you in automatically.

```
heroku login
```

Create an account on [heroku website](https://www.heroku.com/). To create you rfirst app on heroku you have two options: 
create it from the [heroku website](https://dashboard.heroku.com/new-app) (easy) or using cli command-line:
open your cmd/terminal, cd to the project directory (cd stp2json)

create your first app:
```
heroku create --app yourAppName
```

Build the image and push to Container Registry (this will takes a lot of time to build to docker-image):

```
heroku container:push web --app yourAppName
```

Then release the image to your app:

```
heroku container:release web --app yourAppName
```

Now open the app in your browser:

```
heroku open
```
